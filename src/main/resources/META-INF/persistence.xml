<!-- 
This is common place for common properties irrespective of to which DB we want to connect.
Here we can also configure DB (jdbc url, user, pwd). But since we are conecting to multiple DB's,
we are configuring the DB details programatically.
But whatever are common properties irrespective of DB, we add them here

NOTE: Multiple DB's benefit from the same persistance unit name.
